\chapter{BASIC TYPESETTING}
\doublespacing

In these paragraphs, we will display examples for many common features in \LaTeX. The code is shown in \texttt{main.tex} and the associated output in \texttt{main.pdf}. We assume you already know the basic syntactical structure of \TeX with its commands and environments. If you are not familiar, it is recommended you read \texttt{intro to latex.pdf} provided in this package. We will start with the most basic examples of different fonts and styles.

\section*{Fonts and Styles}

\textbf{Bold} font is made using the \texttt{\textbackslash textbf} command. \textit{Italic} font is made using the \texttt{\textbackslash textit} command. \underline{Underline} font is made using the \texttt{\textbackslash underline} command. \texttt{Monospace/teletype} font is made using the \texttt{\textbackslash texttt} command. \textsf{Sans-serif} font is made using the \texttt{\textbackslash textsf} command. \textsc{Small capitals} font is made using the \texttt{\textbackslash textsc} command.

\section*{Math}

One of \LaTeX's greatest strengths is its mathemetical typesetting. You can enter inline math $e^{\mathrm{i}\pi}$. You can also have a math block.

$$
f(x) = \int _{-\infty} ^\infty g(x) \, \mathrm{d}x
$$

You can have numbered equations with the \texttt{equation} environment.

\begin{equation}
	\Phi(n) = \gamma^n + \Delta \gamma \cdot \vec{\zeta}
\end{equation}

You can also align equations by using a \texttt{\&} in the \texttt{align*} environment. Omitting the \texttt{*} will number each line.

\begin{align*}
	h_1 &= \mathbf{X}_1 + N \\
	h_2 &= \mathbf{X}_1 + N \\
	&\vdots \\
	h_n &= \mathbf{X}_n + N \\
\end{align*}

A common mistake is to italcize units in math mode. Units are supposed to be typset in a roman font because $\mu m$ in italic means you are multiplying two variables and $\mathrm{\upmu m}$ means your value is in micrometers. A similar mistake is often made for special functions. If you are using a multi-letter function such as $\sin()$ or $\mathrm{floor}()$, it should not be italic for the same reason as before. To fix these issues, you can use the \texttt{\textbackslash mathrm} command when in math mode to set your text as roman (or upright). Greek letters need to be specified as upright by prepending `up' to the command, e.g., \texttt{\$\textbackslash upmu\$}.

\section*{Quotation marks}
Quotes are written in latex using \texttt{\`} for opening and \texttt{\'} for closing. They can be used for `single' and ``double'' quotes alike.

\section*{Lists}
Bulleted lists are made with the \texttt{itemize} environment. Numbered lists are made with hte \texttt{enumerate} environment. They can be made hierrarchal by embedding another lists within. A bulleted list:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First level
	\begin{itemize}
		\item second level
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
A numbered list:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item First level
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item second level
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Code Listing}
You can make a code block using the \texttt{verbatim} environment. Be mindful that unlike most \TeX environments, it is senstive to spaces (but not tabs) at the beginning of lines so that you may indent your code.
\begin{verbatim}
class Fill:
  def __init__(self, color=BLACK, style='solid'):
    self.color = color
    self.style = style
\end{verbatim}

\section*{Figures}
Figures can be included using the \texttt{\textbackslash includegraphics} command, and their placement and captioning can be configured using the \texttt{figure} environment. Generally, \LaTeX can determine the best placement of your figure on the page itself, but you can give it a placement option of \texttt{h}, \texttt{t}, \texttt{b}, or \texttt{p} to place it \underline{h}ere, on \underline{t}op, on \underline{b}ottom, or on its own \underline{p}age. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=2in]{Figures/lb.pdf}
	\caption{The CSULB logo partially superimposed over a sine wave. This extra text is a test of the caption behavior when there is a longer caption. Lorem ipsum dolor.}
	\label{fig:exampleFig}
\end{figure}

The graphics path is already set

\section*{Tables}
Tables can be generated using the \texttt{tabular} environment, and their placement and captioning is configured with the \texttt{table} environment, like with figures.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{An example of a table}
	\begin{tabular}{l c c}
		\hline
		Color	&  Radius, $r$ [mm] & RMS Voltage, $v$ [V] \\
		\hline
		Cyan	&	72.2	&	2.1 \\
		Magenta	&	45.2	&	5.5 \\
		Yellow	&	78.5	&	1.3 \\
		Black	&	33.3	&	6.9 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:exampleTable}
\end{table}

\section*{Citations and Cross-references}
Many items can be cross-referenced in \LaTeX using labels.\cite{customBibLabel}

\section*{Footnotes}
Footnotes can be placed with the \texttt{\textbackslash footnote} command
\footnote{This is a footnote but it's a very long footnote so that we can test the indent of the footnote text when it leads onto a second line at the bottom of the page.}. 

\section*{Headings}
This document class supports up to third level subheadings or \emph{subsubsections}. Fourth level headings are not currently supported.
